# Kirch's PureData Folder

This is everything I've been doing with Pure Data, starting in 2025 (I can't
seem to find my old PD files from the last time I was interested in PD).

OmniChordKeys is a midi "Omnichord" like device, and OmniChord2 is a WIP improvement

when you clone this repo use `git submodule update --init --recursive` to grab
all the other pureData files that I've been experimenting with (I've been
keeping them in /lib to differentiate from the plugins installed via dekken in
/externals)

abstractions I've put together are in /abs
